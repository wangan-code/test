  This demo is based on the GD32303C-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to configure the CAN 
peripheral to send and receive CAN frames in normal mode.The frames are sent and the 
transmit data are printed by pressing Tamper Key push button. When the frames are 
received, the receive data will be printed and the LED2 will toggle.
 
  This example is tested with at least two GD32303C-EVAL-V1.0 boards. The same demo is 
loaded in all boards and connect L pin to L pin and H pin to H pin of JP14 on the  
boards for sending and receiving frames.
